# Venture Cymru

As a part of my Year 11 GCSE I.T. course, I have to create a website for a company called "Adventure Cymru."

# How to run the website

git clone https://github.com/Morgan-GB/Adventure_Cymru
```

2. CD into the directory

```
cd Adventure_Cymru
```

3. Install node modules

```
npm install
```

4. Run the `server.js` file

```
node server.js
```

5. Go to the link printed in the terminal (example below)

```
Running at: http://localhost:5000
```
